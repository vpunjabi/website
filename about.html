		Like any kid, my childhood was spent eating junk food, hanging out with friends and playing games (my substitute for homework).  When I couldn't go out of the house, I would switch on my AMD computer to play computer games such as Lion King.  It didn't take long for my fascination of computer games to turn into an itch to know how computers worked.

		It was the summer before ninth grade.  I convinced my parents to fund my computer hobby.  I was ready to build my very first computer but did not know where to start.  Learning to be the first step, I signed up for a summer class that taught computer hardware and repairs.  After going through the class, I spent the next few months scouring the internet to buy parts needed for my grand project - build my own computer.  I stumbled and screamed, but succeeded in building a working computer. Amazingly, even now, the computer runs without a hiccup.

		Computers were my hobby but I never imagined a career out of it.  I would spend my summers and weekends volunteering as it gave me satisfaction and joy serving the vulnerable part of the society.  Whether it was cooking food at the homeless shelter or picking up trash, I rejoiced making a difference in people's lives.  This experience greatly influenced my decision when it was time to pick my major for my college career. I thought the best way I could make a difference in people's lives is to become a doctor.  Two years into my undergraduate, my prerequisites were done.  I had gone to India for my holidays and started visiting medical colleges.  On one such trip, I was led into a room which contained specimens with abnormalities.  I saw a woman lying with her eyes closed, as if sleeping; her body was completely cut open and all her organs were clearly visible. I was terribly impacted by the scene. It was at that moment I realized that if I went into the medical field I would have to be de-sensitive to the concept of death. I valued life and the thought of working on lifeless bodies was beyond imagination. Also, the phase of time when living body goes lifeless, I should be without emotions, remain detached â€“ what a un-human behavior.   I knew that I valued life too much to become insensitive to death and that I would have to change my major.  Due to my interest in computers it felt natural for me to go into computers.  I decided that even though the computer field I could still help people.
